###  When and how did you decide to pursue this minor?: 
3rd sem, Peer pressure decision honestly

### Why this Minor?
I believe it is important to know about DS concepts irrespective of the field in today's world. It's practically relevant everywhere.

### Ideal pathway to complete this minor by the 8th semester?
DS203 - DS303(4th sem) or CS419(5th sem) - bunch of courses according to interests

### Pursued Courses
#### 3rd Semester: 
DS203, ME781

#### 4th Semester: 
NA

#### 5th Semester: 
CS419

### Course Prerequisites?
Nothing much, but getting DS203 out of the way earlier helps

### Was it difficult managing your minor alongside core Mech courses?
Slightly, some courses require a lot of commitment (if you care about the grade :), if grade is not an issue, passing comfortably is never going to be a problem unless you astronomically mess up!

### Were you able to connect this minor to your interests, projects, or career goals?
Yes, it helps in other projects that you're doing, because basic ML is mainstream now. I used my DS knowledge in my research intern at Kyoto University for image processing. 

### Any specific courses in your minor that stood out (positive or negative)?
ME781 - slightly difficult for 3rd sem, but as long as you're attentive and put in decent work, it's not difficult getting an AA/AB. 

### Tips for juniors: 
After mandatory courses, go with your interests. Preferably take courses with projects (helps broaden your spectrum and build you profile), and don't worry about the grading stats as much (Minor CPI does not affect your primary CPI). It is the most flexible in terms of courses, which should be leveraged as much as possible.

### Would you recommend doing a minor in general? Why or why not? 
Yes, easy to complete - lot to learn - and relevant in a lot of fields - can also aid your major
