###  When and how did you decide to pursue this minor?: 
i was sure to take this as my minor from 1st year itself, i talked to my ISMP he said you can go for it. Talked to some other seniors and just took it.

### Why this Minor?
I was interested in Aerospace core, and wanted to explore this field along with mechanical engineering. Also these both compliment each other in core job prospects, where I am gonna apply for.

### Ideal pathway to complete this minor by the 8th semester?
Actually mostly the courses which fall under Aerospace minor basket, except AE153, other run during the slots which clash with the core course slots of mechanical engineering and hence is difficult to complete before 5th semester. Mostly the 4 courses you would be forced to complete in last 3 semesters of engineering.

### Pursued Courses
#### 3rd Semester: 
AE153

#### 4th Semester: 
NA

#### 5th Semester: 
NA

### Course Prerequisites?
as per my experience and discussion with other aerospace guys, mostly the syllabus is similar to that of mechanical engineering. but will require some amount of self study, as aerospace courses are bit more mathematical as compared to Mechanical engineering.

### Was it difficult managing your minor alongside core Mech courses?
No

### Were you able to connect this minor to your interests, projects, or career goals?
I can't comment on this as of now, since i just completed one course in 3rd semester, but sure see to complete this minor.

### Any specific courses in your minor that stood out (positive or negative)?
NA

### Tips for juniors: 
I have not completed enough courses to comment on this, but surely do the AE153 in 3rd or 4th semester. It is an easy course, just projects. In 3rd semester your batchmates will be from MTech. and in 4th they will be your 1 year juniors from aerospace department.

### Would you recommend doing a minor in general? Why or why not? 
Yeah, i would surely recommend to pursue minor, if you are interested in a given topic or want to explore it slightly more deeply.
