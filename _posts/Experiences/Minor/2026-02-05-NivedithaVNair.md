###  When and how did you decide to pursue this minor?: 
I decided in my first semester that I wanted to do an Aero minor. I had always been fascinated by aerospace systems and wanted to learn more about them. I also felt that the Mechanical Engineering basics would give me enough foundation to understand aero courses. Initially, I was a little worried there might be too much overlap, but after looking through the course list and content, I realized Aerospace had a lot of fresh material to offer

### Why this Minor?
I liked the idea of space systems and aircraft, and this minor gave me a structured way to explore those interests in depth

### Ideal pathway to complete this minor by the 8th semester?
If you start by your 3rd semester and take one course each semester, you should be done by the 7th. One point to keep in mind is that aero courses usually do not run in the 5th slot, except maybe AE153. This can cause slot clashes with mechanical core courses, but you will almost always find at least one course you like that works out each semester

### Pursued Courses
#### 3rd Semester: 
AE153 - Introduction to Aerospace Engg

#### 4th Semester: 
AE238 - Aerospace Structural Mechanics

#### 5th Semester: 
AE341 Flight Mechanics of Aircrafts and Spacecrafts

#### 6rd Semester: 
AE332 Aircraft Design

#### 7th Semester: 
AE344 Aero Propulsion


### Course Prerequisites?
Yes. AE153 is compulsory for the minor and serves as the gateway to almost all other aero courses. AE238 requires ME223, and propulsion courses typically list fluid mechanics and thermodynamics as prerequisites. Beyond that, a strong grasp of mechanical fundamentals really helps.

### Was it difficult managing your minor alongside core Mech courses?
Not really. If you do your Mechanical courses well and keep your fundamentals clear, the aero courses do not feel overwhelming. In fact, they are very fun to take if you are genuinely passionate about the subject. Time management and planning your course order matter, but it is definitely manageable

### Were you able to connect this minor to your interests, projects, or career goals?
Yes, very much. My interests in space systems were partially fueled by my time in the satellite team, and the aero courses connected beautifully with that. They also fit into my longer-term research interests

### Any specific courses in your minor that stood out (positive or negative)?
I honestly loved all the courses I took. AE238 was a great complement to ME223. I especially enjoyed AE341 (Flight Mechanics of Aircraft and Spacecraft), taught by Prof. Prabhu Ramachandran and Prof. Abhijit Gogulapati; both are excellent teachers. The workload was quite manageable across the courses. For most of them, about an hour of self-study per week was enough, and the exams were usually straightforward. Whenever tutorials were available, solving them proved helpful during exams.

### Tips for juniors: 
The most important tip is to actually attend classes. A minor is something you take by choice, and aero professors are usually very passionate. Their enthusiasm in class is contagious, and you learn a lot more if you are present. Also, have a rough roadmap in mind for what courses you want to take and in what order. You cannot control the slots for your core mechanical courses, but if you know the prerequisites and when you want to clear them, it makes your life easier.

### Would you recommend doing a minor in general? Why or why not? 
I would recommend it if you are truly interested in the subject. A minor should not just be about adding something to your resume. If you feel the subject connects to your interests and career goals, it is worth it. In that case, the learning itself is rewarding and the effort feels worthwhile.
