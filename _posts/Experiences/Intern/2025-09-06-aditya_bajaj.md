I am Aditya Agarwal, currently in my fourth year (after third year when I did the internship). At the end of my third year, I interned at Bajaj Auto Ltd as a CAE-CFD intern working on accelerating simulations using deep learning. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those two months.

### About the Internship:
**Company:** Bajaj Auto Ltd  
**Role:** CAE-CFD Intern (Accelerating simulations using deep learning)  
**Duration:** 2 months (May - July 2025)  
**Mode:** On-site  
**Company Type:** MNC  

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I secured this opportunity through **on-campus placement** - one of the structured recruitment processes available to IIT students.

**Selection Process:**
1. **Technical test**
2. **Resume screening**
3. **Technical interview**
4. **HR round**

### Preparation:
**Academic Preparation:**
- **Second year mechanical course revision** - Focused on core mechanical engineering concepts
- **Foundation knowledge** from thermodynamics and fluid mechanics courses

### Previous Experience That Helped:
**Strong Academic Background:**
- **Two second-year university remote internships** - Provided research experience
- **Publication in fluid domain** - Demonstrated research capability and subject matter expertise
- **AP (Advanced Performance) in Thermodynamics** - Strong academic foundation

### Primary Responsibilities:
**Main Project:** Implementing Deep Learning for Aerodynamic Simulation Acceleration

**Objective:** Develop deep learning models to accelerate traditional CFD aerodynamic simulations by **2000 times** - a revolutionary improvement in computational efficiency.

**Technical Approach:**
- **Deep Learning Integration** with traditional CFD methods
- **Aerodynamic Simulation Optimization** for automotive applications
- **Custom Pipeline Development** - Created complete in-house pipeline for Bajaj Auto
- **Academic-Industry Bridge** - Perfect blend of academic research with real industry applications

### Work Culture & Experience:
**Work Environment:**
- **Pretty chill onboarding process** and overall work culture
- **Proper mentorship structure** - Both mentor and reporting manager allocated
- **Daily guidance** - Regular support for day-to-day activities
- **Collaborative atmosphere** - Conducive to learning and innovation

**Meeting Structure:**
- **Weekly meetings** with reporting manager - Regular progress tracking
- **2 review meetings** - Formal project evaluation sessions
- **Soft skills development** through professional presentations

### Key Learnings:
**Technical Expertise:**
- **Deep Learning Mastery** - Much deeper dive than institute projects
- **CFD-ML Integration** - Unique combination of computational fluid dynamics with machine learning
- **Pipeline Development** - End-to-end system creation for industrial use
- **Research-Application Balance** - Understanding how academic research translates to industry solutions

**Professional Skills:**
- **Weekly presentation skills** - Regular manager interactions
- **Review meeting management** - Formal project evaluation experience
- **Soft skills enhancement** - Professional communication and collaboration
- **Industry research methodology** - Systematic approach to problem-solving

**Unique Achievement:**
Created a **complete in-house pipeline for Bajaj Auto** - a significant contribution that demonstrates both technical capability and practical implementation skills.

### Career Impact:
**Career Decision:** **I would like to continue with Bajaj Auto for a career in the automobile industry** - This internship provided clear direction toward automotive sector specialization.

**Industry Clarity:** Gained valuable insights into how automotive companies approach computational challenges and innovation.

### Recommendations for Juniors:
**Primary Strategies:**
- **Prioritize campus hiring** - Structured and reliable pathway
- **Company portal applications** - Direct applications through official websites
- **LinkedIn referrals** - Leverage connections for referral opportunities

### Advice for First-Time Interns:
**Interview Preparation:**
- **Be very clear about your purpose** of application during interviews
- **Future commitment clarity** - Especially important to articulate whether you'd like to continue with the company
- **Genuine interest demonstration** - Show authentic interest in the role and company

**Application Approach:**
- **Purpose-driven applications** - Apply to companies you're genuinely interested in joining long-term

### Common Misconceptions:
**Stipend Reality:** **Core companies usually pay less during internships** (like Bajaj Auto), **but PPO (Pre-Placement Offer) compensation is quite different from internship stipend.**

**Important Understanding:** Don't judge core company opportunities solely based on internship stipend - the full-time offers are typically much more competitive.

### Core vs Non-Core Decision:
**Personal Recommendation:** **Depends on the individual for sure.**

**Important Consideration:** **If you have interest in core and you're going for non-core just because of low pay in core, then that's something I might not approve of.**

**Key Principle:** Make career decisions based on genuine interest rather than short-term financial considerations, especially regarding internship stipends.

### Final Thoughts:
This internship was transformative in demonstrating how cutting-edge technology (deep learning) can revolutionize traditional engineering problems (CFD simulations). The 2000x speed improvement project showcases the potential of interdisciplinary approaches in modern engineering.

**Key Takeaway:** Core engineering internships, especially in established companies like Bajaj Auto, provide excellent opportunities to work on innovative projects that bridge academic research with practical industrial applications.
