**Career Clarity:** This experience helped me:
- Understand what type of work I **don't prefer**
- Think critically about **what line of work genuinely interests me**
- Make **informed decisions** about future career direction

**Valuable Learning:** Sometimes discovering what you don't enjoy is as important as finding what you love.

### Recommendations for Juniors:
**Primary Sources for Second Year Internships:**

- **LinkedIn searches** (especially startups)
- **Company websites** - Direct applications
- **Placement cell opportunities** - Structured programs

### Advice for First-Time Interns:
**Application Phase:**

  - Networking with industry people
  - Interview preparation

**Mindset:**
- **Don't be discouraged by rejections**

### Common Misconceptions:
**Reality Check:** **Higher pay doesn't necessarily mean you'll enjoy the internship.**

**Better Approach:** Prioritize opportunities that **genuinely interest you** over just compensation packages.

### Core vs Non-Core Decision:
**Recommendation:** **Do a second year non-core intern if you're not sure about continuing with core.**

**Benefits:**
- **Early clarity** about preferences
- **Informed decision-making** for future career choices
- **No regrets** about unexplored options

### Final Thoughts:
This internship was valuable for providing **career clarity** rather than just technical skills. Understanding that supply chain work wasn't my passion helped me make better decisions for my future career path. The excellent work culture and mentorship at ITC made it a positive learning experience overall.
