I am Om Inamdar, currently in my third year (after second year when I did the internship). In my second year summers I interned at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) as part of the Summer Research Fellowship Programme (SRFP). This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those two months.

### About the Internship:
**Program:** Summer Research Fellowship Programme (SRFP) by Indian Academy of Sciences  
**University:** Indian Institute of Science (IISc)  
**Supervisor:** Dr Konduri Aditya, Computational Data and Sciences  
**Duration:** May 17 - July 13, 2025 (continuing remotely till end of year)  
**Mode:** On-site  
**Research Area:** CFD + ML  
**Funding:** Yes (funded internship)

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I found this opportunity through the Summer Research Fellowship Programme (SRFP) organised by Indian Academy of Sciences. However, there were also interns who had directly cold-mailed the professor. The application process required:
- Resume
- Letter of Recommendation (LoR)

I got to know about this programme through a batchmate, which was quite helpful in the application process.

### Research Project:
**Title:** Super-resolution of fluid flow on non-uniform meshes using GNNs

The research topic was jointly discussed and decided between myself and the supervisor. My project involved using graph neural networks to replicate fine mesh results of a DNS simulation using a coarser mesh of a LES simulation.

**Technical Details:**
- Original DNS simulation: 256√ó256√ó256 size grid
- LES simulation: 64√ó64√ó64 size grid (significant computational time savings)
- Goal: Pass LES results through Graph Neural Network to match DNS accuracy
- Application: Turbulent flows

This approach aims to achieve high-accuracy results while dramatically reducing computational requirements.

### Experience Highlights:
**What I Loved:**
- Bangalore weather was fantastic! üå§Ô∏è
- The professor was really nice and chill about work hours as long as the work was completed
- Everyone in the lab was very friendly and we went out together many times
- Got to explore Bangalore during my stay
- Great work-life balance

**Timeline:**
- Offline work: 2 months (May 17 - July 13, 2025)
- Remote work: Continuing till end of 2025

### Overall Recommendation:
I would rate this experience a **10/10** and absolutely recommend both the professor and university to others. IISc provides an excellent research environment for undergraduate students interested in cutting-edge computational research.
