I am Purvi Rathore, currently in my third year (after second year when I did the internship). In my second year summers I interned at Bank of Baroda as an Operations Risk Intern working on ML projects. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those two months.

### About the Internship:
**Company:** Bank of Baroda  
**Role:** Operations Risk Intern (ML Project)  
**Duration:** 2 months (May and June 2025)  
**Mode:** On-site  
**Company Type:** MNC  
**Department:** IT  

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I secured this opportunity through a combination of **referral and cold emailing**.

**Selection Process:**
- Resume screening
- One interview (more of an interaction to understand my interests)

### Preparation & Previous Experience:
**Key Preparation:**
- **ITSP Computer Vision Project** - This was crucial for my role
- **Data Science Minor** - Helped me understand basic ML concepts needed for the work

**Previous Experience That Helped:**
- ITSP (Institute Technical Summer Project) provided the foundational computer vision knowledge

### Primary Responsibilities:
**Main Project:** Signature Fraud Detection System
- Developed a **signature fraud detection model**
- Built a **website interface** for the model
- Created a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** intended for bank-wide integration
- End-to-end development from model creation to web implementation

### Work Culture & Experience:
**Challenges:**
- **Limited guidance** despite receiving some mentorship
- **Poor work culture** - didn't enjoy the working environment
- **Few young employees/interns** in the IT department
- Bank doesn't officially hire UG interns, making integration difficult
- **Very limited interaction** with senior employees except manager

**Onboarding:**
The IT department structure wasn't conducive to intern integration, leading to isolation from broader team interactions.

### Key Learnings:
**Technical Skills:**
- **Independent CV Model Development** - Built computer vision model from scratch
- **Hands-on Machine Learning Experience** - Valuable practical implementation
- **Full-stack Development** - Website creation and integration

**Non-Technical Skills:**
- **Real-life corporate experience** - Understanding professional environments
- **Senior Interaction Skills** - How to communicate with leadership
- **Presentation Skills** - Presenting work to leadership team
- **Professional Soft Skills** - Corporate etiquette and communication

### Career Impact:
**Important Realization:** This internship helped me decide that **I don't want to continue/pursue ML roles in the future**. Sometimes knowing what you don't want is as valuable as knowing what you do want.

### Recommendations for Juniors:
**Primary Strategies:**
- **LinkedIn outreach** and **cold mailing** are most common methods
- **Prioritize referrals** - Look for contacts who can refer you (makes process simpler and faster)

### Advice for First-Time Interns:
**Application Mindset:**
- **Keep trying** - Don't get disheartened by rejections
- **Learning Experience** - Take every procedure as a learning opportunity
- **Follow Your Passion** - Most importantly, choose what you like

**Reality Check:**
Don't be discouraged by rejections; persistence and genuine interest in the role matter more than perfect applications.

### Core vs Non-Core Decision:
**Recommendation:** **Focus on what you want to do**. Don't choose roles based on external pressures or expectations - align internships with your interests and career goals.

### Important Takeaway:
This internship was valuable not because I loved the work, but because it provided **clarity about my career direction**. Understanding what doesn't excite you is equally important for making informed career decisions.
