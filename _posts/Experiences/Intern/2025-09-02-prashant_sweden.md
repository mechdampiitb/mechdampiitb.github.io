I am Prashant Vashisht, currently in my third year (after second year when I did the internship). In my second year summers I worked remotely with Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden on materials research. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience.

### About the Internship:
**Institution:** Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden  
**Supervisor:** Shafiqul Islam, Mechanical Engineering  
**Duration:** May - July 2025  
**Mode:** Remote  
**Research Area:** Materials (Sheet Metal Anisotropy)  
**Funding:** No (unpaid internship)

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I secured this opportunity through cold emailing professors. My application email included:
- Introduction about myself
- What excited me about the professor's work
- My past experience
- What I could offer to the ongoing research

I managed the entire application process independently without external help.

### Research Project:
**Title:** Studying Anisotropy in Sheet Metals Using Cupping Test Simulation and Experimental Analog

**Research Question:**
How does anisotropy influence the deformation of a circular hole in a sheet during a cupping test, and can this deformation be quantified using both simulation and physical analogs?

**Hypothesis:**
Anisotropic sheet metals exhibit non-uniform deformation under biaxial stretching, converting a circular hole into an ellipse. Isotropic materials maintain nearly circular deformation. By simulating various materials using Hill'48 yield criterion in Abaqus and replicating tests using plastic sheets and 3D-printed dies, we can correlate deformation geometry with material anisotropy.

**Implementation Strategy:**

*Simulation (Abaqus):*
- Set up cupping test geometry with circular hole in sheet
- Use Hill'48 yield criterion to introduce anisotropy
- Vary r-values to simulate different materials
- Measure ellipse deformation, punch force, and failure depth

*Experimental Analog:*
- Construct setup using plastic sheets and 3D-printed clamps/dies
- Record deformation using overhead video
- Use computer vision and ML algorithms for ellipse fitting and contour detection
- Extract semi-major/minor axes and deformation depth
- Compare results with simulation trends

**Expected Outcome:**
A comprehensive framework for detecting anisotropy in sheet materials using both advanced simulation and accessible experimental methods, demonstrating feasibility for low-cost quality testing.

### Overall Recommendation:
I would rate this experience a **6/10**. While the research project was technically challenging and provided good exposure to materials testing and simulation, the remote nature and other factors affected the overall experience.
