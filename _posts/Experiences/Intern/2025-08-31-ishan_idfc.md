I am Ishan Pandit, currently in my fourth year (after second year when I did the internship). In my second year summers I interned at IDFC First Bank as a Data Science Intern. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those two months.

### About the Internship:
**Company:** IDFC First Bank

**Selection Process:**
1. **Initial resume screening**

4. **Final interview** with Lead Data Scientist of AI Labs team

### Preparation:
**Key Focus Areas:**
- **Thorough knowledge of projects** - Main testing area for second-year internships
- **ML concepts and GenAI knowledge** - Since interviewer led the GenAI team
- **Project understanding** - More important than DSA for data science roles

**Previous Experience That Helped:**
Projects were the **main differentiator** - they expect limited experience from second-year students, so strong projects are crucial.

### Primary Responsibilities:
**Main Domain:** Generative AI

**Key Projects:**
- **SQL Query Generation Automation** for IDFC First Bank's extensive database
  - Built custom LLM agent using LangChain and OpenAI API
  - Implemented LLM-based evaluation techniques

### Work Culture & Experience:

**Work Environment:**
- **Amazing work culture!** Very supportive and approachable team

- **Career direction clarity** - Understanding of preferred work environment

**Important Note:** Even if you're not completely sure about your direction after internship, that's perfectly normal - you have time to figure things out!

### Recommendations for Juniors:
**Best Strategy:** **Referrals** - Send resume through contacts to directly reach OA stage
- Ask parents for contacts in companies with relevant roles
- Much easier than cold applications

### Advice for First-Time Interns:
**Mindset Preparation:**
- **Be ready for a completely new world** - New people, high self-expectations, potentially overwhelming corporate offices
- **It's an amazing experience** to meet people working in your desired field

**Maximize Opportunity:**
- **Don't limit yourself to just working** 
- **Talk to many people** (even outside your team)
- **Learn from diverse backgrounds and journeys**
- **Network actively**

### Common Misconceptions:
**Reality:** Office people are **NOT** busy and unhelpful. In fact:
- Most people are **happy to see interns**
- They **love helping and talking** to interns
- They're **interested in your story** and future plans
- They **don't have unrealistic expectations**
- They're **more than happy to support** you

### Core vs Non-Core Decision:
**Depends completely on your interests and passion:**
- **Core interest + Core career plans** = Core internship or research
- **Non-core certainty** = Better to discover early through non-core internships
- **Early clarity helps** long-term career planning
