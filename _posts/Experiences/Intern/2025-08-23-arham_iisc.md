I am Arham Shah, currently in my third year (after second year when I did the internship). In my second year summers I interned at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) working on multiphase CFD research. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those two months.

### About the Internship:
**University:** Indian Institute of Science (IISc)  
**Supervisor:** Gaurav Tomar, Department of Mechanical Engineering  
**Duration:** May 10 - July 5, 2025  
**Mode:** On-site  
**Research Area:** Multiphase CFD  
**Funding:** No (unpaid internship)

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I secured this opportunity through cold mailing professors. My application included:
- Resume
- Cover letter briefly describing my projects

I didn't receive help from anyone during this process and managed the entire application independently.

### Research Project:
**Title:** Research Intern For CFD in Multiphase Flow

The research topic was jointly discussed and decided between myself and Professor Tomar. I worked in the field of multiphase CFD and learned to use Basilisk, an open-source solver that specializes in:
- Adaptive grid refinement
- Surface tension dominant flows

**Research Focus:**
My primary work involved studying binary droplet collisions in air and investigating the conditions that determine whether droplets will:
- Coalesce (merge together)
- Bounce off each other

I am continuing to work on different problems in this area even after the internship concluded.

### Experience Highlights:
**What I Loved:**
- Bangalore weather and food were excellent
- Great atmosphere in the lab with a positive work culture
- Learned advanced CFD techniques using cutting-edge tools
- Hands-on experience with adaptive mesh refinement

**Current Work:**
I'm continuing research on different problems in multiphase flow, building on the foundation established during the internship.

### Overall Recommendation:
I would rate this experience an **8/10** and recommend both the professor and the research area to others interested in computational fluid dynamics and multiphase flows.
