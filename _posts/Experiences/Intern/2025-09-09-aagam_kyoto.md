I am Aagam Sheetalkumar Kasaliwal, currently in my third year (after second year when I did the internship). In my second year summers I interned at Kyoto University as part of the KU-STAR Program. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those two months.

### About the Internship:
**Program:** KU-STAR Program  
**University:** Kyoto University  
**Supervisor:** Giordano Mattoni and Yoshiteru Maeno (Physics Department)  
**Duration:** 18th May, 2025 - 18th July, 2025  
**Mode:** On-site  
**Research Area:** Physics - low temperature measurements  
**Funding:** Yes (funded internship)

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I found this opportunity through the KU-STAR Program which was communicated via webmail by IITB. The application process required:
- CV
- Transcript
- Statement of Purpose (SOP)
- Letter of Recommendation from Prof

I received significant help during this process from professors, specifically Prof. Darshan Shah, who provided guidance and support.

### Research Project:
The research topic was jointly discussed and decided between myself and the supervisors. I worked in the field of low-temperature measurements in physics, which involved understanding fundamental physical phenomena at extremely low temperatures.

### Experience Highlights:
**What I Loved:**
- Kyoto is a wonderful city with excellent logistics and well-organized infrastructure
- The research environment was conducive to learning
- Got exposure to cutting-edge physics research

**Challenges:**
- Food was an issue for pure vegetarians like myself

### Overall Recommendation:
I would rate this experience a **10/10** and absolutely recommend both the professor and university to others. The KU-STAR program provides an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to engage in high-quality research at one of Japan's premier universities.
