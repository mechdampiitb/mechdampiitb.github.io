I am Vraj Shah, currently in my second year (after first year when I did the internship). In my first year summers I worked as a Research Assistant intern at IIM Indore. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those months.

### About the Internship:
**Position:** Research Assistant (RA) Intern  
**Institution:** IIM Indore  
**Supervisor:** Ankit Surana, Strategy Department  
**Duration:** February 2025 - May 2025  
**Mode:** Remote  
**Research Area:** Bibliometric review  
**Funding:** Yes (funded internship)

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I secured this opportunity through cold emailing professors. My application included:
- CV

I received valuable help from mechanical engineering seniors during this process, which was crucial for a first-year student navigating the internship application process.

### Research Project:
**Area:** Bibliometric Review

The research topic was jointly discussed and decided between myself and the supervisor. The project involved conducting systematic literature reviews and bibliometric analysis, which provided excellent exposure to research methodology and academic writing.

*Note: Detailed project description to be shared separately via direct message.*

### Experience Highlights:
**What I Loved:**

- Remote work experience which taught time management skills

**Timeline:**
The internship lasted for 4 months (February - May 2025), providing substantial research experience for an early-career student.
