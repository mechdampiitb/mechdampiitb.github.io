I am Taniishq Kadam, currently in my fourth year (after second year when I did the internship). In my second year summers I interned at Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) Mumbai Refinery as an Operations & Maintenance Intern. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those six weeks.

### About the Internship:
**Company:** Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL)  
**Location:** Mumbai Refinery  
**Role:** Operations & Maintenance Intern  
**Duration:** 6 weeks  
**Mode:** On-site  
**Company Type:** Public Sector  

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I secured this opportunity through **referral**. The selection process involved one interview to assess my capabilities and accordingly allocate a suitable project.

### Preparation:
I focused on reviewing mechanical core concepts essential for refinery operations:
- **Fluid Mechanics**
- **Thermodynamics** 
- **Heat Transfer**
- Understanding applications in equipment like pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, and turbines

### Previous Experience That Helped:
Projects pursued in **Mechanical Core courses** were particularly helpful in strengthening my application and understanding of the work environment.

### Primary Responsibilities:
**Project Focus:** Mumbai Refinery Turnaround Optimization

**Background:** Mumbai Refinery processes crude oil and separates it into valuable products like petrol, diesel, naphtha, and LPG. Every refinery conducts yearly maintenance called "overhaul" or "turnaround" to maintain various equipment and units.

**My Project:**
- Understand the process of turnaround activities
- Identify areas where activities could be made quicker and cost-effective
- Conduct discussions with officers and engineers for in-depth process understanding
- Analyze workflow to identify potential delays and inefficiencies
- Compile comprehensive list of inefficiencies
- Develop mitigation strategies to reduce delays

### Work Culture & Experience:
**Onboarding:**
- Very smooth process
- Company provided essential safety equipment (boiler suit, safety shoes, helmet)
- All safety protocols essential for refinery work

**Work Environment:**
- **Welcoming culture** at Bharat Petroleum
- Company takes excellent care of interns and employees
- **Benefits:** In-office meals, manageable working hours
- **Mentorship:** Decent guidance, though getting time from senior employees required persistence

**Pro Tip:** As an intern, take initiative and be persistent while seeking time from others for dependencies.

### Key Learnings:
**Technical Knowledge:**
- Excellent exposure to various functioning units and equipment in a refinery
- Could relate classroom mechanical core concepts to real-world applications
- Understanding of refinery processes and maintenance operations

**Soft Skills:**
- Learned to interact with stakeholders at different levels
- Communication with on-ground engineers to managers
- Significant boost in ownership and confidence
- Professional workplace interaction skills

### Career Impact:
This internship helped confirm my interest in roles such as:
- **Field Engineer**
- **Supply Chain Manager**
- Other roles requiring on-ground work in plants or factories

### Recommendations for Juniors:
**Primary Sources for Second Year Internships:**
- PT Cell internships
- LinkedIn opportunities
- Company websites
- Institute seniors
- Referrals through family members

### Advice for First-Time Interns:
**Mindset:**
- Be **patient and persistent**
- **Prioritize valuable exposure** over high stipend
- Be open to opportunities offering decent exposure in fields you want to explore
- Remember that limited opportunities exist for second-year students

**Reality Check:**
As a second-year student, opportunities are limited, but focus on gaining meaningful experience rather than just monetary benefits.

### Final Thoughts:
This internship provided invaluable hands-on experience in the petroleum industry and helped solidify my interest in core mechanical engineering applications. The exposure to real industrial processes and the opportunity to work on optimization projects made it a highly rewarding experience.
