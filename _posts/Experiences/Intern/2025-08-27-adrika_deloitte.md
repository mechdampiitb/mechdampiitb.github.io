I am Adrika Das, currently in my third year (after second year when I did the internship). In my second year summers I interned at Deloitte as a Regulatory and Financial Risk Intern. This article gives an overview of how I got this internship and my experience during those two and a half months.

### About the Internship:
**Company:** Deloitte  
**Role:** Regulatory and Financial Risk Intern  
**Duration:** 12th May - 25th July, 2025  
**Mode:** On-site  
**Company Type:** MNC  
**Department:** Strategy, Risk and Transactions  

### How I Got the Opportunity:
I secured this opportunity through **cold emailing** completely. I targeted partners at the top of the corporate hierarchy throughout Mumbai, which proved to be an effective strategy.

**Selection Process:**
- Aptitude test (basic maths, stats and English)
- Interview round

**Preparation:**
No specific preparation apart from usual resume preparation. Companies generally don't expect prerequisites from second year interns - the IIT Bombay tag is usually sufficient.

### Previous Experience That Helped:
- **Noqs Digital** internship (an IIT Bombay startup)
- Various projects that strengthened my application

### Primary Responsibilities:
**Main Project:** Developing credit risk models for Deloitte
- Completed 2-3 Udemy courses on credit risk modelling using Python
- Used Jupyter notebook for implementation
- Created training assets for new Deloitte employees in Strategy, Risk and Transactions department
- Applied linear regression, logistic regression, and other ML concepts

**Additional Work:**
I proactively approached another partner for more work opportunities:
- Model validation on various scorecards for two client banks  
- Assisted an NBFC with regulatory circulars
- Client-facing work experience

### Work Culture & Experience:
**Onboarding:** Smooth month-long process via emails and calls with HR flexibility

**Work Environment:**
- Excellent opportunity to interact with experienced professionals face-to-face
- Professionals were excited to teach finance concepts
- Team based in Hyderabad and Bangalore (limited direct interaction)
- Strict corporate environment (formals required except Fridays)

### Key Learnings:
**Technical:**
- Developed strong interest in finance
- Learned that finance is incredibly diverse with extensive learning opportunities
- Gained hands-on experience with credit risk modeling

**Non-Technical:**
- How to conduct myself in a strictly corporate environment
- Overcame initial hesitation about approaching senior professionals
- Developed confidence to ask for help and insights
- Enhanced personality and communication skills

### Career Impact:
This internship significantly increased my interest in finance and helped clarify my career direction toward the finance domain.

### Recommendations for Juniors:
**Tools for Outreach:**
- Apollo.IO (if functional)
- PowerLead
- ContactOut
- Gmail with Streak extension

**Strategy:**
- Always email people at the top of corporate hierarchy (Partners, Senior Management)
- Target 10,000+ emails if necessary
- Don't get disheartened by low response rates

### Advice for First-Time Interns:
**Application Phase:**
- Don't be disheartened if you send thousands of emails with few responses
- Second-year internships have a significant luck component
- Leverage connections without shame if available

**Important Reality Check:**
- Brand tags matter more than actual work for future recruitals (except tech roles)
- 90% of students landing big firm internships have leveraged connections
- Don't compare yourself with others who may not be truthful about their methods

### Common Misconceptions:
- **Future recruiting:** Recruiters do value brand tags more than internship work (except tech)
- **Success stories:** Most people with prestigious internships used connections, not just cold mailing

### Core vs Non-Core Decision:
**Recommendation:** Follow your interests. If interests aren't developed, branded firms like Big Four are safer options as they have multiple departments.

### Final Advice:
For on-site internships, extract maximum value from colleagues and higher-ups - not just knowledge, but also networking and connections.
