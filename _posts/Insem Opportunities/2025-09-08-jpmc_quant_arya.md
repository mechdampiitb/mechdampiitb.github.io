### How did you first come to know about the program?
Social Media.

### Application Process
Registration, Online Aptitude Test, Case Study Challenge, Interaction Round.

### Timeline
- Jan 12, 2025 – Registration deadline
- Jan 18, 2025 – Online Aptitude Test
- Jan 25–26, 2025 – Case Study Challenge
- Jan 29, 2025 – Interaction Round

### Test Format & Difficulty
The aptitude test had two parts:
- **Advanced Mathematics** – 14 questions, JEE-level difficulty
- **Quantitative Ability** – 16 questions, easy to moderate level

Time allotted: 30 minutes in total.

This was followed by a technical section with 10 coding questions (15 minutes).

### SOP/Essay
None.

### Interview Rounds
There was 1 interaction round, focused entirely on the case study from the previous stage. The questions tested our understanding of the concepts used. If one had worked on the case study sincerely, this round felt more like a discussion and was relatively easy.

### Other Evaluation Criteria
Apart from the test and case study, evaluation focused on conceptual clarity, problem-solving approach, and communication during the interaction round.

### Preparation Strategy
I didn't prepare much for the aptitude round, though practicing technical questions beforehand could help since they were slightly tough. For the case study, no prior preparation was needed, JPMC provided all the required material with concepts sufficient to solve the problems. If something was unclear, I referred to online resources to understand the concept and then applied it to the case questions.

### Senior/Peer Connections
None.

### Benefits/Outcomes
The program offered mentorship from JPMC professionals, exposure to real-world quantitative finance problem-solving, and valuable career guidance. At the end of the program, we were also given the opportunity to directly interview for the 3rd-year summer internship with JPMC, which is a major advantage.

### Most Valuable Aspect
For me, the most valuable aspect was the mentorship and structured learning. The program had various sessions on finance topics, and the assignments after each session ensured that we applied the concepts and understood them deeply. Along with this, interacting with JPMC professionals gave me clarity about quantitative finance as a career, and the direct interview opportunity for the summer internship was a huge motivation.

### Advice for Future Applicants
Take this opportunity seriously; the program is less about prior knowledge and more about your willingness to learn. The aptitude test and technical section can be prepared for with some practice, but for the case study, the material JPMC provides is more than enough. Be honest, consistent, and curious while solving assignments and attending sessions. Finally, make the most of the mentorship, since it can give you both clarity in quantitative finance and a valuable internship pathway.
