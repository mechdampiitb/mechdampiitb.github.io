### How did you first come to know about the program?
By a senior who got into the program - Parul Diwan, had a talk about it in December 2024.

### Application Process
All rounds were eliminatory/filtering in nature:
1. Test - Games (3 puzzle like sections) + personality test (MCQ or scale rating based)
2. Resume filtering
3. Interview round 1 - mostly HR
4. 2 day fully-funded visit to Hyderabad P&G plant and office (tour, senior leader interaction, stay at Westin with meals included, goodies) + interview round 2
5. PIO offer

### Timeline
- Extended test deadline was: 8th May 2025
- Resume filtering: within 1-2 days afterwards
- Interview round 1: around mid-end May
- 2 day visit: 3rd and 4th July
- PIO offer: mid July

### Test Format & Difficulty
This info is easily available on internet (Google, YouTube).

**Games section: 3 games**
- 1st game: Simple maths operation - +, -, * or /; fill in the missing digits
- 2nd game: Logic based - observe the algorithm and guess the output if input is given or vice versa
- 3rd Game: Memory and focus based - dots flashed on the screen with 2-3 easy questions after that. You need to remember the order and position of dots after answering the questions

**Personality test:** MCQ based or scale rating based. A little time consuming - lot of questions.

**Overall difficulty for both all tests:** Easy  
**3rd game difficulty:** Medium

### SOP/Essay
NA

### Interview Rounds
2 rounds:
- 1st was HR
- 2nd was HR + resume based (resume based was more heavily focused upon with in-depth questions about my internship experiences, all projects and a few PORs. However, this isn't the general trend, most panels stick to HR even in resume based questions)

### Other Evaluation Criteria
Overall personality is heavily focused on, not the skills you have.

### Preparation Strategy
Honestly, I couldn't. I was on a vacation in a different timezone. For me, everything was super rushed and impromptu/spontaneous.

### Senior/Peer Connections
Yes, mainly to get an idea about the interview questions. This was super helpful as I was able to prepare those questions in advance. Most were HR/personality related.

### Benefits/Outcomes
Pre-internship offer.

### Most Valuable Aspect
- Prepping for the HR rounds truly made me introspect and learn quite a bit about myself
- Learnt a lot about P&G and FMCG in general and helped me a lot in choosing my career path - reduced the uncertainty
- Made great friends in just 2 days, enjoyed my time thoroughly
- Seeing the plants - the cleanliness and how neat everything is - I was awed

### Advice for Future Applicants
- Check out YouTube before giving the test and interviews
- During the 2 days of the P&G plant and office visit, enjoy yourself thoroughly and make friends
- Don't stress about the interview, it's the most chill interview any company can offer. There isn't much you can prep anyways; it's mostly about your personality
