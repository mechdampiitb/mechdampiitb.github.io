### How did you first come to know about the program?
From my seniors.

### Application Process
Registration.

### Timeline
Feb - May.

### Test Format & Difficulty
It was a case test in 1st round but didn't explicitly prepare for it, used AI ;) all the way. It was just a screening process anyways, mostly everyone passes.

### SOP/Essay
No SOP.

### Interview Rounds
There were 2 rounds, both Partner rounds of approx 30 mins, typical case interview, first few mins of intro and HR question and rest a consulting case, no HR round.

### Other Evaluation Criteria
3 rounds of case competitions, preparing a 5 page ppt on an original startup idea. The template or the slide headings were fixed and given in detail by them.

### Preparation Strategy
YouTube CIC channel, CCG casebook, IIMA and SRCC case Book.

### Senior/Peer Connections
Yes, it was very helpful. Took help of many different seniors mainly who were in top 3 in campus round, asked for their ppt, asked them to review our ppt, did some practice runs with them and their suggestions were extremely helpful.

### Benefits/Outcomes
Top 3 teams in India will get direct internship otherwise a pre-internship interview, but companies prefer not to take students from PII, they took no one out of 21 students from PII but top 3 teams got in instantly.

### Most Valuable Aspect
The experience and the valuable skills I gained along the way.

### Advice for Future Applicants
Try to be in top 3 teams obviously 🫠. How? Get in contact with seniors (not just from IITB) who did good last year as well as who didn't and understand why, make a balanced team, and don't keep everything till last day specially for ppt submission.
