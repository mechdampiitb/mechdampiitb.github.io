### How did you first come to know about the program?
Through webmail.

### Application Process
The application process was simple, limited to some basic info like name, branch, CPI and some other details.

### Timeline
The first round was in Feb and the competition lasted till the finals in the last week of May.

### Test Format & Difficulty
First round involved a test to be given by all applicants. It was a case with a chatbot, the difficulty level was fairly between easy to moderate considering cases asked in consult interviews. The format was in a way that each question is a buildup for the case wherein you type the answer and at the end you have to summarize the case in time limit of one minute. Further rounds were mostly based on a startup idea pitching and making a perfect deck.

### SOP/Essay
There was no such thing.

### Interview Rounds
The competition involved total of 4 rounds including test. Second round was making a team out of shortlisted students and a deck on a startup idea. Post this 3 teams were selected for semi-final round which involved pitching to a principal at BCG, it an online round. The finals was offline at BCG's Delhi office. The top 3 teams got PIOs while others got a chance to interview with BCG for summer intern.

### Other Evaluation Criteria
Evaluation criteria was simple, the clarity in deck and good prediction on potential of idea backed by market research.

### Preparation Strategy
It was mainly experience of other case competitions and some senior interactions on how consult case interviews happen.

### Senior/Peer Connections
Yes, connecting with seniors was really helpful. There were no preset evaluation criteria so we understood some from seniors who qualified last time and also practiced our pitches with them.

### Benefits/Outcomes
The program offers PIO to top 3 finalists and interview chance for other finalists.

### Most Valuable Aspect
It's mainly about the exposure, the opportunity to understand new ideas and meet new people and the way it makes you push your limits.

### Advice for Future Applicants
I would recommend them to try out this but not from intention of getting internship but to be at the top. That might help you explore a lot more things than just conventional stuff.
