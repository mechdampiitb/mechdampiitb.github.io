### Guiding Professor and University
Rahul Deshpande, University of Melbourne



### Project Title
 Effects of Reynolds number and spatial resolution on the pressure source terms in turbulent boundary layers







### Field
Fluid Dynamics


### How did you reach out to the prof?

Cold mailing, got email address from university webpage

### How did you prepare for your first meeting with the prof? What previous knowledge was required?

I was asked to prepare a presentation on one of my projects mentioned in resume, which was related to GANs (super resolution GANs in paticular) to realise the feasibility of its application in turbulence work. The first meet was a kind of informal, no as such cross questioning took place. It was assumed that I was well versed with fluid mechanics concept. Previous knowledge of topic wasn’t required since turbulence is an advanced topic and we are not expected to know well about it during btech.

### What was the research topic? How did you arrive at it? (did the prof give it/did you explore & find it yourself)
The research included Wall-Pressure Study in Turbulent Boundary Layers. The topic of the project was decided well in advanced but I was introduced to it once the basic readings and literature review got completed.

### What was the duration of the project?
May 2024- August 2024

### What was the work done by you as part of the project? Who were the other stakeholders involved?
• Conducted in-depth analysis of a Direct Numerical Simulation database of a turbulent boundary layer
• Estimated sources of Wall-Pressure fluctuations from datasets, enhancing turbulence understanding
• Quantified velocity gradient estimation errors from under-resolved datasets, enhancing CFD methods
• Wrote research paper and presented work in FMFP conference 2024
Paper presented at FMFP2024 is now being processed for publication as an Edited Book Chapter in Volume 1. of the entire set of books (six volumes) by Springer as part of the Lecture Series in Mechanical Engineering
Here’s the link to the paper- [2412.19474] Effects of Reynolds number and spatial resolution on the pressure source terms in turbulent boundary layers
Only me and my mentor (Rahul Deshpande) were the stakeholders involved.

###What was the mentorship style like and how often did you meet with the professor?
The schedule was pretty chill. Talking of the mentorship, I was taken with a very proper pace from basics to advanced that allowed me to go for a proper publication. We had weekly meetings and met biweekly when paper submission date was close.

###How was the overall experience? (Key learnings & Challenges)
 It was a really great experience. I will mention some common challenges for all projects at the end of this doc.

### What are the future plans following this project?
I am writing journal paper, extending this research paper to submit in Springer Journal soon.

### What would you tell someone who is considering their first research project?
Research projects demands patience which one will realise while going through the literature review phase involving reading multiple research papers and connecting them with the project in hand. You may seem to go nowhere but suddenly at some point you will start connecting the dots and take leadership of the project. DON’T just skim through research papers. Read them very properly to have proper gasp of the topic.
