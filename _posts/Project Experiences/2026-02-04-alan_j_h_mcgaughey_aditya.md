Aditya Agarwal


### Guiding Professor and University
Dnyanesh Pawaskar, IIT Bombay 

### Project Title
Mathematical Modeling and Simulation of Biological Tumors


### Field
Solid mechanics + Biology


### How did you reach out to the prof?
Got selected through In-Semester Undergraduate Research Programme (ISURP)

### How did you prepare for your first meeting with the prof? What previous knowledge was required?
Prepared basic concepts of solid mechanics. 

### What was the research topic? How did you arrive at it? (did the prof give it/did you explore & find it yourself)
Modeled necrotic core temperature and flux distributions, enhancing tumor behaviour understanding

### What was the duration of the project? 
Dec’23-Apr’24

### What was the work done by you as part of the project? Who were the other stakeholders involved?
•Utilized FEM simulations in ANSYS, achieving 98% accuracy in modeling tumor temperature distribution
• Identified the impact of compressive stress on tumor growth dynamics within the immediate environment

Carried out project with Dhriti Maniar

### What was the mentorship style like and how often did you meet with the professor?
Weekly meetings, slow paced since it was a semester long project.

### How was the overall experience? (Key learnings & Challenges)
The main challenge was to learn Ansys software. It took alot of time to figure out its features and use it for our own purpose. Got to learn a great blend of solid mechanics and biology.

### What are the future plans following this project?
Not much scope in continuing this project further

What challenges you faced during the project?

I took up two remote research projects during summer of 2024 which became a bit tedious at one point because the expectations grew after deciding to go for a publication for Melbourne work. Though I got accepted by 5 universities, I chose melbourne and CMU due to their high QS ranking and sufficient gaps in time zones to prevent clashes.
